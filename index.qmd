# Preface {.unnumbered}

The goal of this project is to test the different ways to specify languages in Quarto. This mimic the situation where some chapters are in a language are in a different language than the one of the rest of the document.

-   Is the TOC displayed in the main book language?

-   Are the cross-references (table, equation, figure, *etc.*) displayed in the chapter language?

-   Are the language specific typographic rules applied using the chapter language?
